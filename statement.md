# PYTHON String Manipulation

In this playground we will write introduce 5 programs that will convert a string into PascalCase, Title Case, snake_case, camelCase and Kebab-Case.

## Program 1: Title Case
This is the simplest case to implement. Title Case is written where the first letter of each word is capitalised.
Luckily, Python has a built in function for this:
```
string = "this is a string."

print(string.title())
```
The result of this code will be: "This Is A String."
